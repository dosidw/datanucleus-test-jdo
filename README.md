# dosi-issue-02_fetch_groups

We have `fetch-fk-only` but want to get full objects with custom fetch groups. Setting `recursionDepth` on a custom fetch group for a
query does not win vs `fetch-fk-only` currently, so it just retrieves the FK.

The `recursionDepth` we set on the fetch group seems never read by the code during execution of such queries, at least it
looks like that in the debugger.

Template project for any user testcase using JDO.
To create a DataNucleus test simply fork this project, and add/edit as 
necessary to add your model and persistence commands. The files that you'll likely need to edit are

* <a href="https://github.com/datanucleus/test-jdo/tree/master/src/main/java/mydomain/model">src/main/java/mydomain/model/</a>   **[Put your model classes here]**
* <a href="https://github.com/datanucleus/test-jdo/blob/master/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml">src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml</a>   **[Put your datastore details in here]**
* <a href="https://github.com/datanucleus/test-jdo/blob/master/src/test/java/org/datanucleus/test/SimpleTest.java">src/test/java/org/datanucleus/test/SimpleTest.java</a>   **[Edit this if a single-thread test is required]**
* <a href="https://github.com/datanucleus/test-jdo/blob/master/src/test/java/org/datanucleus/test/MultithreadTest.java">src/test/java/org/datanucleus/test/MultithreadTest.java</a>   **[Edit this if a multi-thread test is required]**

To run this, simply type "mvn clean compile test"
